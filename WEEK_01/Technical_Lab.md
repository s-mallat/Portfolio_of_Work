<h3> Arduino Handbook Exercises</h3>

<h4>This section includes explorations using Arduino and Tinkercad. Similarily, this page is also an <br> practice exercise to familiarize myself with the Github platform. </h4>

<h3> 01 - Building A Basic Circuit: <br>
Resistors, LEDs, & Switches </h3>
<p> This section is divided into three separate figures. The first depicting a basic circuit, followed by two different <br> explorations of series & parallel circuits </p>

<p>^Figure 3.0. This lab didn't work as there were bugs in the code and I don't think it would work <br> anyway because it requires an actual sensor and maybe a sensor library as well</p>

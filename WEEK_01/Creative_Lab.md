<h4> Introduction</h4>
<p>All things in this time-space, biotic and abiotic alike, are made of matter. Drawn into existence by chemical bonds and electrostatic attraction, to put it simply. If everything around us is but a collection of millions and millions of microscopic atoms that form molecules and similarity disintegrate, then humans, theoretically, should also be capable of altering their physical state. This research department is currently in the process of creating two complementary devices, EX204 and EX304, which will allow humans to finally transcend physical form and move from one conscious state to other. </p>

<p>This long research journey, if deemed successful, will be the inception to a new era of science and technology. The purpose of this research is to relocate all living organisms on a deteriorating Earth to the exoplanet, Kepler-452b, which has a similar environmental structure to Earth. The goal is to allow us to travel through space and time as particles that can move at the speed of light whilst retaining our consciousness. As we will no longer be bound by physical mass, relocating to exoplanets similar to our own and discovering a world beyond the observable universe becomes a feasible possibility; one we could only have dreamed of  a hundred years ago. Moreover, our carbon footprint will dramatically diminish; thus, allowing Earth to slowly recover over time and become a habitable planet with a stable environmental once again. This research is our last sign of hope for a future unshackled by environmental disasters and catastrophic events that are the unfortunate result of human greed.</p>

<h4>Devices & Initiation</h4>
<p>EX204 and EX304 are complementary devices that exchange information to build a safe and successful experience. Both devices are microscopic in size and will be inserted into specific areas in the brain. The EX204 will be inserted into the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain and its main function is to replicate the user’s consciousness into every cell in the body upon activation. This will allow the user to retain their consciousness in different physical states and serve as a guide to allow particles to recognise each other in order to reassemble into the original human physical state.</p>

<p>On the other hand, EX304 is the device responsible for the conversion of the body from one physical state to another. Upon addition of both devices through surgical means, the user needs to go through an orientation session to understanding how the devices operate. Furthermore, the user will then initiate the devices by adding specific hand gestures or finger movements along with voice activation into our lab’s database. Once this information has been stored by our system, the program will automatically download the data on both devices in the brain. Thus, the devices will be ready to use. </p>

<h4>Activation Guide --> (Learned Affordances)</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The activation procedure relies on sensors to detect a series of movements and auditory input.</li>
  <li>In order for the following steps to work, the user must register their unique hand gesture and voice<br> beforehand, so that the sensors can pick up accurate input.</li>
  <li>The user only needs to say the word "ACTIVATE" and the system will automatically respond.</li>
  <li>A virtual light panel, only visible to the user, will appear on eye level.</li>
  <li>Next, the user should use the light panel to draw the hand gesture programmed into the initiation <br> database and the devices will start working accordingly.</li>
  <li>To cancel the activation process, the user may swipe left or right, and the light panel will disappear.</li>
  <li>The system has a built in safe mode which will deactivate the devices 60 minutes upon activation.</li>
  <li>To deactivate safe mode, use our lab's website to log into your account to modify the default settings.</li>
  <li>Modifications to any settings can be done at any time, however, we are currently limited to only <br>coordinates within the Milky Way.</li>
  <li>Our network is the interstellar interactive network which allows us to stay interconnected using <br>radio waves and satellites. For more information about our network, please visit our website.</li>
  <li>To change back and forth between physical states, the user only needs to say the word "REVERSE" and <br>the system will automically respond.</li>
  <li>User will able to produce sound waves in any physical state since sound is a series of particles <br>that vibrate to produce auditory input which can then be detected by our sensors.</li>
  <li>For a more comprehensive guide on how to use our technology, kindly contact us through SpaceTime <br>or book one of our coming soon guided extraterrestrial expeditions to Mars and Venus.</li>

<h1>Puppet Hand Reflection Exercise</h1>
<hr>

The puppet hand lab was a collaboration between me and Zeynep Melis Meri√ß. 
<br>
The moment we finished soldering & putting the puppet hand together, we were both worried about accidently ripping some of the wires off or messing the puppet somehow. Therefore, we were initially very careful with it and as such, it felt like an odd extension of our actual hand that didn't perform as 
well as the orignal. However, the more we experimented with it & as we added the pressure sensor and sound features, the puppet became more familiar and easier to use / handle.
<br>
Before attaching the pressure sensors to the puppet hand, we tested them by taping them on my actual hand to see if they work properly. Obviously, there was more control  when I used my actual hand to apply pressure and bend the sensors.  However, I really enjoyed the experience of building this lab and at the same time, I got to practice soldering  since we had to redo that process quite a few times! 
<br>
One of the biggest challenges we had while creating this lab was the thumb finger. We tried to attach the sensor to it several  times, but in the end, it got ripped off every time we used the hand. So, in the end, our puppet hand didn't exactly become a usuable hand, but it was fun to create and it also makes you think about what makes an object an extension of us and what makes it feel like a foreign entity that is disconnected from us.

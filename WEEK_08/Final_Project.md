<h4>Input 1 (MPR121) & Output 1 (Vibration Motor)</h4>
<p>Upon activation of the circuit, the vibration motor will activate once to alert the user of their increased stress levels. After that, the MPR121 sensor will activate and this allows the user to turn the motor on and off according to their need.</p>

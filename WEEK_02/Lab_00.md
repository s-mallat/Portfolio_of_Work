<h4>1. How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?</h4> 
<p>You can hook up two red LEDs in a series to a 220 Ohm resistor and they will both work. Adding more red LEDs will result in losing voltage through out the circuit and the LEDs will get dimmer and some of them will not work at all. Moreover, the number of LEDs used is also relevant to the color of the LEDs. In other words, red LEDs hold a forward voltage of approximately 1.8V, however, other LEDs have higher forward voltage and might require a different resistor value to light up. </p>

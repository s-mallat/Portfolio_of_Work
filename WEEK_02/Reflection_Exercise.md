<h4>1. Reflect on creating interfaces for your body. Consider how we engage with tools – how does this impact how your body extends into the tools around you? What possibilities do you see?  </h4> 
<p>As a left-handed person, I’ve struggled a lot with handling tools over the years. I still remember how frustrating it was to spend days trying to change my Wacom tablet orientation so that I can use the side buttons, or the many moments in computer labs where I attempted and failed (due to the short wires) to move the mouse from the right side of the table to the other end. It’s not all bad though, since I eventually learned to use my right hand for everything except writing. This brings me to the most fascinating aspect of human learning, the brain. While I am fascinated by how the hand has shaped the way we interact with the world, I am even more fascinated by the infinite possibilities that our brain creates for us. According to Haggard, P. et al (2010), our brain has a flexible understanding of the limitation of the physical body. In other words, the brain can process foreign objects and allow them to become an extension of our bodies (Haggard, P. et al, 2010). Therefore, creating endless possibilities while using the hand and body as powerful mediums to interact with the world using technology as an extension of us (Perry, P., Schedel, M., 2022). </p>

<h1>Week 06</h1>

This week was dedicated towards familiarizing myself with different sensors, how to use their arduino libraries, and putting the circuit together on the regular Arduino Leonardo.  I initially started using the Pulse Sensor, then later switched to the Galvanic Skin Response instead.

<h1>Week 07</h1>

In week 07, I started switching to the Arduino Nano BLE. Unlike the Leonardo, the BLE only worked with 3.3V power and so I had to be very careful not to damage it with the 9V battery. The biggest challenge in this week was getting the motor to work on the BLE board. In the end, I created a relay circuit just for the motor so it can be powered separately from the rest of the components.

<h1>Week 08</h1>

In this week, I finally started soldering my circuit. The challenge wasn't the soldering itself but where to place the wires on the strip board. Since the Arduino Nano is small and already had soldered pins on it from both ends, I had to design my strip board into two levels to be placed on top of each other. The strip board had to be small as well, since my project is a wearable device so there was a lot thinking behind the placement of each wire and how many Power & Ground columns I had and how many pins can be placed in each column.

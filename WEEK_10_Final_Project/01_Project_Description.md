<h1>Project Concept</h1>

<p>To better explain the inspiration behind my project, I'd like to tell a short story about my journey with anxiety and panic attacks. For years I was overcome with bouts of panic attacks in silence and I remember desperately wishing back then for some way to make them instantly stop or to just go away. Back then, I would resort to my endless list of bookmarked web pages full of writings / breathing techniques / distraction exercises to make it go away.Mental health issues are still heavily stigmatized in many parts of the world and as such, many people out there are still afraid to seek help due to fear of being labelled "crazy" or "weak minded." After all, if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you must be imagining things!
  <br><br>
Yes! A doctor said that to me once.
  <br><br>
Therefore, I wanted to create a device that helps people who find themselves often trapped in their own negative thoughts becoming spectators of the outer world while they remain bystanders stuck inside an invisible bubble. In other words, this device measures the user's stress levels and attempts to ground them (make the user focus on outside stimuli as a way to distract the them) and help them overcome high levels of agitation and stress.</p>

<h1>Project Objectives</h1>

| Conceptual Objectives  | Technical Objectives |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| To create a device that helps alleviate high stress levels / agitation and panic attacks  | To design and create a device that integrates several inputs & outputs to reach a better understanding of Arduino, sensors, motors and so on  |
| To reduce the fear factor associated with panic attacks which plays a huge part in triggering them to begin with. This is done by showing people that panic attacks aren't really that scary once one learns how to control them using specific exercises | To develop a stronger familiarity with schematic drawings and how to move from a circuit diagram to physically building it and putting together  |
|  To normalize seeking mental health advice & having devices or games catered towards helping people overcome them in a similar fashion to how we have many devices that help with alleviate physical health conditions  | To create a complex interaction between different inputs and output put togethr through wiring and coding  |
| To shift the mental image of fear and distress that is associated with negative emotions. In other words, create a more colourful image using colourful LEDs and cool gadgets  | To transform a soldered circuit into an actual usable device by creating an appropiate housing for it and showing how the user can interact with the device  |

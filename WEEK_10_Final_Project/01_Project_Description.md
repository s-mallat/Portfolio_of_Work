<h3>Project Concept</h3>
<p>To better explain the inspiration behind my project, I'd like to tell a short story about my journey with anxiety and panic attacks. For years I was overcome with bouts of panic attacks in silence and I remember desperately wishing back then for some way to make them instantly stop or to just go away. Back then, I would resort to my endless list of bookmarked web pages full of writings / breathing techniques / distraction exercises to make it go away.Mental health issues are still heavily stigmatized in many parts of the world and as such, many people out there are still afraid to seek help due to fear of being labelled "crazy" or "weak minded." After all, if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you must be imagining things!
  <br><br>
Yes! A doctor said that to me once.
  <br><br>
Therefore, I wanted to create a device that helps people who find themselves often trapped in their own negative thoughts becoming spectators of the outer world while they remain bystanders stuck inside an invisible bubble. In other words, this device measures the user's stress levels and attempts to ground them (make the user focus on outside stimuli as a way to distract the them) and help them overcome high levels of agitation and stress.</p>
